Version Control is a change log that shows what changes were made, who made the 
changes, and why the changes were made. Version Control is especially useful 
when working as a team because it keeps track of changes that could otherwise 
get lost with a number of people doing things. It also provides accountability 
for programmers making the changes. A programming team might use Github to 
manage version control as they work on a website. They could each work on a 
different page of the website. Each page is related but somewhat independent as 
well. This team can "pull" the changes of their colleagues to make "push" their 
changes so their coworkers can see what they did. This allows multiple people 
to be able to work at the same time without missing updates or interfering 
negatively with each other. A version control command "git commit -m "message 
explaining changes goes here" which commits the staged changes.
